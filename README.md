# automationOfJobsSql
The subject of the project is to present the application of task automation
in databases. Database automation means using the processes and tools offered by the database system to make the tasks performed based on the based on the data stored in it are simpler and safer, and minimize the the use of human resources in the operation of the system. By using automation, it reduces the number of errors during the implementation and maintenance of the environment, and there is greater reliability reliability and more efficient implementation of changes. The automation of processes for acquisition and processing of data furthermore allow to increase their efficiency and scalability. Performing jobs without manual intervention means that employees will spend less time checking and updating code, and more time instead for installing patches, scaling, application development and other tasks. It can be concluded that task automation in a database environment is very useful and should be used in virtually every implementation. The purpose of this project is to present the functionalities of the Oracle Scheduler mechanism that can be used in daily database operations.
